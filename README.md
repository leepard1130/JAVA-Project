## Minecraft
### assign_1: The goal of this assignment is to implement a set of classes and interfaces — themed around a blockworld— to be used in later assignments.<br>
### assign_2: The goal of this assignment is to add a set of classes and methods to those developed in Assignment 1. You will implement precisely the public and protected items described in the supplied documentation (no extra members or classes).<br>
### assign_3: Follow the description to complete the application by using MVC framwork and design a user-friendly interface by Java GUI<br>
## OneSKY Australia project
### The OneSky simulation application is meant to be able to represent the entire Australian airspace. For the purposes of the simulation, we will say that aircraft are meant to be separated at all times by one kilometre. Each cell in the BoundedCube will represent one cubic kilometre. We will also say that the Australian airspace will contain a maximum of 20,000 aircraft at any one time. Your BoundedCube design should take into consideration efficient use of memory and must be able to represent the entire Australian airspace on a computer with 8 GB of memory.<br>In this project, we need to design our data structure to implement the necessary features. All the built-in packages are not allowed to use in this project.
## Keyword Search Engine in the works of William Shakespeare
### Your application needs to implement the following searches:
### 1. Count the number of occurrences of a word.
### 2. Search for a single word.
### 3. Search for a prefix of a word. (e.g. Searching for “obscure” would find “obscure”, “obscured”, “obscures” and “obscurely”.
### 4. Search for a phrase, where a phrase is a sequence of words that are contiguous (e.g. “to be or not to be”).
### 5. Implement boolean search logic for the operators AND, OR and NOT. (There are two parts to the fifth search. One part is to find all lines which match the search criteria. The second part is to find all occurrences of the terms in the search criteria within one or more sections of the document.)
